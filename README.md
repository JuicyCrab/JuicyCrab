# 👋 Hi, I'm Eyasu Smieja!

I'm a student excited about AI/ML, data-driven projects, and how technology shapes our daily lives. I’m not an expert (yet!), but I love learning and experimenting—especially with:

- **Python** (FastAPI, Scikit-learn, PostgreSQL) | **Java** | **React** | **R**

## 🌟 What I'm Into

- Experimenting with AI/ML across different domains, including hardware, sports analytics, and education
- Creating a positive impact with technology
- Playing sports and traveling
  
## Currently Working On

- GenLearn — a personalized course-generation platform that creates curated learning paths tailored to a user's skill level, goals, time availability, and constraints.
  - Features include an AI assistant that generates course outlines, selects and ranks credible resources, adapts difficulty over time, and produces an exportable study plan.
  - Tech stack: FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL, Python for ML/NLP, and a React frontend.
  - Status: MVP prototyping — building the backend APIs and initial curriculum-generation models. Looking for feedback and collaborators.

## 📚 Learning

- How to create secure and clean APIs with FastAPI
- The underlying structures of supervised ML models
- How to build meaningful tech with a human touch
